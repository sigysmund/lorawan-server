# Infrastructure Administration

## Servers

The list shows a single line describing the current server instance:
 - **Node** name, which is useful for [debugging](Development.md#debugging)
 - **Version** of the server
 - **Free Memory** and **Free Disk**
 - **Alerts** that may need your attention:
   * `system_memory_high_watermark` when more than 80% of available system memory
     is allocated
   * `process_memory_high_watermark` when any Erlang process has allocated more
     than 5% of total system memory
   * `disk_almost_full` if any disk partition uses more than 80% of the available
     space

The detailed view shows also:
 - **Performance** of the server in the number of requests and errors per minute
 - Detailed overview of all system **Disks**


## Gateways
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gotthardp/lorawan-server/master/doc/images/admin-gateway.png)

The server can be connected to one or more LoRaWAN gateways. All gateways act
as one distributed antenna, common to all Networks:
 * The server receives device uplinks from all gateways that received the signal,
   regardless to which Network does the device belong.
 * Downlinks are them sent to the gateway that indicated best RSSI (Received
   Signal Strength Indication).

For each LoRaWAN gateway you can set and view its physical parameters:
 - **MAC** address of the gateway
 - **Group**, which is an opaque string with application-specific settings.
 - **TX Chain** identifies the gateway "radio chain" used for downlinks (usually 0).
   It shall correspond to a `radio_x` (e.g. `radio_0`) with `tx_enable: true`
   in gateway's `global_conf.json`.
 - **Antenna Gain (dBi)** can be set to ensure the *TX Power* + *Antenna Gain*
   is below the maximal allowed Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)
   for the given Network.
 - **Description** for your convenience.
 - **Location** and **Altitude** of the gateway

### Status

For the status:
 - **Alerts** that may need your attention:
   * `disconnected` when no UDP packet has been received from the gateway for
     more than 20 sec
 - **IP Address** shows the gateway endpoint as viewed by the the server
 - **Last Alive** contains a timestamp of the last received pull request. A gateway is
   considered dead if it didn't sent anything for more than 60 seconds.
 - **Last Report** shows a timestamp of the last status report
 - **Network Delay** graph shows network (LAN) delay between the gateway and the server
   measured during the [`PULL_RESP`](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.TXT#L274)
   sequence. Note this requires packet_forwarder v3.0 or higher.
 - **Transmissions** graph shows how much did the gateway transmit in past hour.
   This is useful to monitor regulatory compliance.

The gateway power is always a minimum of *TX Power* and (max EIRP - *Antenna Gain*).


## Networks

The server can handle one or more networks. Each Network configuration covers:
 * Network Identifier used to create DevAddr for newly joined nodes
 * LoRaWAN Regional Parameters, including additional frequencies (channels)

To correctly define the Regional Parameters you should review the specification
"LoRaWAN Regional Parameters v1.0.2" or the suggested
[Default Regional Configuration](Regions.md) for your region.

On the General tab you can set:
 - **Name** of the network.
 - **NetID** of the network. Private networks should use 000000 or 000001.
 - **SubID** in the format *HexValue*:*Length* specifies the (optional) fixed
   bits in the DevAddr (see below).
 - **Region** that determines the LoRaWAN regional characteristics that cannot be modified.
 - **Coding Rate** is always "4/5".
 - **RX1/RX2 Join Delay** defines the JOIN_ACCEPT_DELAY1 and JOIN_ACCEPT_DELAY2.
 - **RX1/RX2 Delay** defines the RECEIVE_DELAY1 and RECEIVE_DELAY2.
 - **Gateway Power (dBm)** defines a default transmission power for downlinks.

The *NetID* and *SubID* are used to create DevAddr of OTAA devices. Each DevAddr
is composed of 7 LSB of NetID, followed by *X* *SubID* bits, followed by 25-*X*
random bits. This allows operator to define separate private sub-networks using
the same *NetID*.

The *US 902-928MHz* region allows a *Private Hybrid* mode introduced by
[Multitech](www.multitech.net/developer/software/lora/introduction-to-lora).
This is useful when you want to split the radio spectrum to 8 different sub-bands,
but it requires custom device firmware.

### ADR

On the ADR tab you can set the initial parameters of your devices:
 - **Max EIRP** (dBm) used in your region. For each region it is defined in the
   "Data Rate and End-device Output Power encoding" section.
 - **Max Power** defines the first item in the "TX Power Table"
 - **Min Power** defines the last item in the "TX Power Table"
 - **Max Data Rate** defines the last (lowest SF) item in the "TX Data rate table"
 - **Initial RX1 DR Offset** defines the offset between the uplink data rate and
   the downlink data rate used to communicate with the end-device on the first
   reception slot (RX1).
 - **Initial RX2 DR** defines the data rate for the second reception slot (RX2).
   See the "Receive windows" section.
 - **Initial RX2 Freq** defines the default frequency in the RX2 receive window.

### Channels

On the Channels tab you can set:
 - **Initial Channels** enabled in your devices.
 - **Channels** define a list of additional channel frequencies sent to the device
   during Join (CFList).

## Multicast Channels

Class B and Class C devices support multicast. Multiple devices can be configured
to listen for downlinks targeted to a given *DevAddr*, so the same frame can be
received by a group of devices. See also the [Communication](Communication.md) guide.

To define a multicast channel you need to set:
 - **DevAddr** of the channel; this must not collide with any *Node* address.
 - **Profiles** that have this multicast configured.
 - **NwkSKey** and **AppSKey**
 - **FCnt Down** is the broadcast frame counter.


## Events

This list includes an overview of errors and warnings that have occurred during
the last 24 hours. Each specific error or warning is listed only once. Complete
listing of errors and warnings is in the server logs.

Each record contains
 - **Severity** of the issue: error, warning or info.
 - **First Occurred** timestamp
 - **Last Occurred** timestamp, which gets updated everytime this event occurs.
 - **Count** of occurrences, which gets increased by 1.
 - **Entity** concerned by the event: server, gateway, device, node, connector.
 - **EId**, which is an identifier of the concerned entity.
 - **Text** and **Args** of the event.

Description of the various errors and warnings is provided in the
[Troubleshooting Guide](Troubleshooting.md).
